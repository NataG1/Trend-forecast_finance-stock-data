## Stock Price Analysis and Trading Strategy Project

## Overview
This project analyzes historical stock data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 2010-2022, implements a moving average crossover trading strategy, and develops a machine learning model to predict stock price movements. The analysis includes data retrieval, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, strategy implementation, backtesting, and model evaluation.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into 8 milestones that progress from data acquisition to model evaluation:

Milestone 1: Data Retrieval and Pre-processing
Set up Python environment with necessary libraries

Retrieve historical stock data using yfinance

Perform initial data cleaning (remove missing values and duplicates)

Milestone 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize stock closing prices to identify trends

Generate statistical summary of the data

Key observation: Apple's stock showed significant growth starting around 2019, with a sharp rise in 2020-2021 followed by volatility in 2022

Milestone 3: Moving Averages and Technical Indicators
Calculate 10-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMAs)

Plot SMAs along with closing prices to visualize trends

Observation: Moving averages help identify momentum shifts and potential support/resistance levels

Milestone 4: Moving Average Crossover Strategy
Generate trading signals based on SMA crossovers (buy when MA10 > MA50, sell when MA10 < MA50)

Visualize buy/sell signals on price chart

Milestone 5: Backtesting the Strategy
Simulate strategy execution using historical data

Track portfolio value over time with initial capital of $100,000

Calculate daily returns and portfolio performance

Milestone 6: Machine Learning Introduction
Feature engineering: Create returns and moving average features

Train Random Forest classifier to predict next day's price direction

Model accuracy: 51.01% with relatively balanced feature importance

Milestone 7: Performance Metrics and Evaluation
Evaluate model using confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC score

Generate precision-recall curves and feature importance analysis

Results: Model shows modest predictive power with AUC-ROC score of 49.39%

Milestone 8: Reporting and Visualization
Key insights about trend identification, strategy behavior, and market regimes

Discussion of practical implications for trading strategy implementation

# Installation Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:

text
pandas
yfinance
matplotlib
numpy
seaborn
scikit-learn
Install dependencies using:
bash
pip install pandas yfinance matplotlib numpy seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
Clone or download the project files

Ensure all required packages are installed

Run the code sequentially through each milestone

# The code will:

Download AAPL stock data (2010-2022)

Clean and preprocess the data

Generate visualizations and statistical summaries

Implement and backtest a trading strategy

Train and evaluate a machine learning model

# Key Findings
The moving average crossover strategy captures major sustained trends well but struggles during volatile markets

The machine learning model shows modest predictive power (51% accuracy)

Short-term moving averages (MA10) are the most important feature for predictions

The strategy performs best in strong bull markets and underperforms during high-volatility periods

# Files Included
Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing all code for the 8 milestones

Generated visualizations (charts and graphs)
